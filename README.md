# GruntBoilerplate
A boilerplate for Grunt. 

The Grunt.js file contains a small logic to do some basic stuff which I need every other time for small projects.

Mainly includes copying files from one environment to another, minifying and concatenating CSS and JS, changing scripts and stylesheets from html files based on environments, etc.. 

Contains the below packages:

 - grunt-contrib-concat
 - grunt-contrib-uglify
 - grunt-contrib-watch
 - grunt-contrib-cssmin
 - grunt-contrib-copy
 - grunt-contrib-clean
 - grunt-processhtml
 
### Installation

```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt
```
### Libraries

 - jQuery
 - Fontawesome
 - Bootstrap
 
This is unfinished. More stuff on the way with better configurations.
